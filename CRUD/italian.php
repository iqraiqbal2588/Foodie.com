<h3>#Italian Food</h3>
  <p>
  Many cheeses and dairy products are made in Italy.[81] There are more than 600 distinct types throughout the country,[82][83] of which 490 are protected and marked as PDO (Protected designation of origin), PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) and PAT (Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale).[84]

Olive oil is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, replaced only in some recipes and in some geographical areas by butter or lard.[85] Italy is the largest consumer of olive oil, with 30% of the world total; it also has the largest range of olive cultivars in existence and is the second largest producer and exporter in the world.[87][88] Bread has always been, as it has for other Mediterranean countries, a fundamental food in Italian cuisine.[89] There are numerous regional types of bread.[89]

Italian cuisine has a great variety of sausages and cured meats, many of which are protected and marked as PDO and PGI,[90] and make up 34% of the total of sausages and cured meats consumed in Europe,[91] while others are marked as PAT.[92]

Meat, especially beef, pork and poultry, is very present in Italian cuisine, in a very wide range of preparations and recipes.[93] It is also important as an ingredient in the preparation of sauces for pasta. In addition to the varieties mentioned, albeit less commonly, sheep, goat, horse, rabbit and, even less commonly, game meat are also consumed in Italy.[93]

Since Italy is largely surrounded by the sea, therefore having a great coastal development and being rich in lakes, fish (both marine and freshwater), as well as crustaceans, molluscs and other seafood, enjoy a prominent place in Italian cuisine, as in general in the Mediterranean cuisine.[94] Fish is the second course in meals and is also an ingredient in the preparation of seasonings for types of pasta.[95] It is also widely used in appetizers.[96]

Italian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes.[97] Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are namedâ€”penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, lasagne, and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like ravioli and tortellini.[97]
